Frontend Application for CS309 Semester Project

``export FLASK_APP=app.py``

## Warning
This is (at least in its current state) **not** a production ready product. This is in no way shape or form a production ready application.It is most likely filled to the brim with poor code, security issues, and other bad things. This is a simple project in an area I am not very experienced in, im trying to get better. Therefore tread lightly, and don't get too upset at the bad code.


## Dependancies
* Flask
* MySQL Connector
Install
``pip install flask mysql-connector``
